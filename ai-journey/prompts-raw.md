Read README.md and senior-backend-engineer/instructions.md, then CLAUDE.md.
Do not write any code yet.

1. Summarise the task as: must-have requirements, evaluation criteria, explicit non-goals,
   and submission deliverables (incl. ai-journey).
2. Identify every ambiguity or open design question yourself. Think about at least:
   username rules and uniqueness, whether the assignee must exist, behaviour of
   "list work items" for an unknown user, ID type, error/response contract, persistence.
3. Ask me about them with AskUserQuestion, max 4 per batch. For each question give 2–3 options
   with trade-offs and mark your recommended default.
4. After I answer, log each decision in ai-journey/decisions.md (AI proposed vs. final).
5. Finally, draft a short message I can send to the hiring contact with the 2–3 questions
   that genuinely need THEIR answer (not mine), stating the default I'll assume meanwhile.

Propose the architecture for this modular monolith. Do not write code.

Cover:
- Solution/project layout and the allowed project reference graph (draw it as a list or mermaid).
- Module boundaries: what each module's Contracts exposes, and how WorkItems validates an
  assignee without depending on Users internals. Compare a synchronous in-process contract
  vs. integration events + local read model.
- Domain model per module: aggregates, value objects, strongly-typed IDs, invariants, and
  where cross-aggregate rules (e.g. username uniqueness) live.
- CQRS: compare the FastEndpoints built-in command bus, the Mediator (source-generated) library,
  and MediatR (note its current licensing). Recommend one for this task and justify.
- Persistence: per-module store, in-memory option, and how it stays swappable.
- Request/response and error contract (status codes, validation, problem details).
- Testing strategy: domain unit tests, architecture tests for boundaries, a few endpoint
  integration tests. Name the libraries.
- Implementation order as vertical slices, each ending green.
- What we deliberately leave out (time box 2–4h).

For every major decision give 2 options + trade-offs + your recommendation.
Ask me (AskUserQuestion) about anything where reasonable seniors would disagree.

Append the approved plan to ai-journey/plan.md and log the decisions in ai-journey/decisions.md.

<pasted_content id="8051">
Implement step 1 of the plan only: solution, projects, project references, shared building
blocks, the host wired with FastEndpoints + Swagger, and an empty architecture-test project
with a first passing boundary test. Then fill in the Commands section of CLAUDE.md.
Run dotnet build and dotnet test. Stop and show me the project reference graph.
Suggest a commit message.
